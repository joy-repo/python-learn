I’m excited to have joined the ICB team as Vice President, under the leadership of Julien P. Campana. With 11 years of experience in software development across various domains, my focus will be on driving new feature development and strengthening system resilience.

Originally from Kolkata—the City of Joy and the home of rosogolla—I’m eager to contribute meaningfully to our shared mission and collaborate in creating lasting value.
